# Prëss

Prëss is a little tool for Speedrunner. With it, you can display the key & the button you press on the screen. For now, you need the select the window to use it (if you don't do that, the tool cannot detect the mouvement of you pad and you have error display on the window).

When you launch it, you just have to press a button on the gamepad you want to use. After that, you can add a window capture and add a chroma key with the color `#FF00FF` or `255 0 255`. If you want to change the pad, just press the `C` key and press a button on the gamepad you want to use!

For now, it's just track the left stick and the four button of the XBox pad!
